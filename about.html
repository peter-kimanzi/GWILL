            <p class="about__container-data" data-scroll>The Blessed Heart Community Center was founded in the year 2012 and later registered in the year 2013 in July with the vision to be a center for excellence for children in the KCC slum. The Blessed heart self- help group was started by mothers in the KCC slums in Umoja 3 next to KCC dairy factory. The started as a self -help group of women who would contribute money to buy food and then share it amongst their families. They did this to get a good price for their food by buying in bulk, this they did as a way to ensure food security for their households.</p>

            <p class="about__container-data" data-scroll>They then later decided to start a day care to meet the need for day child care as well as the rising need for the same in the community. Later on faced with the need for an accessible and affordable education for the children in the community, the group decided to expand their vision to meet this need. The project has grown to serve 50 children, currently they have rented 6 rooms which they use for day care, pre-school and lower primary classes.</p>

            <p class="about__container-data" data-scroll>Blessed Heart community is currently registered as a community based organization with a mission of transforming the KCC slum by providing an accessible education, excellent life skills training, instilling positive character to raise learners to be responsible leaders and committed citizens</p>

            <p class="about__container-data" data-scroll></p>


            <p data-scroll>Our community center has started a school and day care to support the educational needs of poor children within the community while also providing a safe space for children to be taken care of during the day and thereby enabling mothers to engage in economic activities to support their children. <span
